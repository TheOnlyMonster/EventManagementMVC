# Event Management MVC Project

## Overview

This project is an Event Management system built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, focusing on facilitating event creation, user registration, and event management. It leverages the power of ASP.NET Core with Entity Framework Core for data management and Identity for user authentication and authorization.
